## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

A Data Engineer with a strong focus on building scalable, reliable, and high-performance data pipelines/systems. My expertise spans **data modeling**, **ETL/ELT pipeline development**, and **big data processing** using tools such as **Apache Spark**, **Kafka**, **Airflow**, and **Databricks**.  
Skilled in **Python**, **SQL**, and distributed computing frameworks, I excel at designing **end-to-end data workflows** that transform raw data into actionable insights.  

With hands-on experience across **cloud platforms** like **AWS**, **GCP**, and **Azure**, I specialize in optimizing **data storage**, **query performance**, and **streaming architectures** to support both **real-time** and **batch processing** needs.  I am passionate about creating **robust data infrastructures** that empower **analytics**, **machine learning**, and **business intelligence** solutions.  

By combining software engineering principles with modern data engineering practices, I deliver efficient, automated, and resilient systems that enable organizations to make data-driven decisions at scale.

## DevOps Projects

### End to End Machine Learning Fraud Detection Solution using Kafka | Airflow |Apache Spark | SCIKIT | MLFlow 

A machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent transactions using real-time data processing and model orchestration.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow, from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, tuning, and deployment. It leverages both batch and streaming components to provide scalable and efficient fraud detection.

### Realtime Stock Anomaly Detection using Kafka | Quix Streams | Elastic Search | SKLearn

This project will be in four (4) Parts. We will start with an introduction to Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) to manage and provision cloud resources. Iac is all about using code rather than manual processes to create and provision cloud infrastructures. We will also dive into Packer to create immutable resources, Terraform Cloud and use Ansible to carry out further configurations after the resources have been created.

### Image Classification Using Pytorch

In this project, I improved the prediction accuracy of an existing machine learning model created by [FAHAD MEHFOOZ](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fahadmehfoooz/pneumonia-classification-using-pytorch/notebook). I was able to archive a 7.05% improvement in the model's accuracy by tuning few hyper parameters, introducing a validation dataset to guide against overfitting, etc.

### Population Growth vs. Energy Consumption

In this project, I explored the relationship (if any) between population growth of a country and it's energy consumption. It was surprising to find out that there is somewhat a negative relationship between Population Growth and Energy Consumption worldwide.
